<h2>Ethical issues relating to the technology, your personal reflections and recommendations </h2>

<h4><em>The ethics around cyber warfare are complicated. While individual hackers acting on behalf of nation-states should be responsible for not causing harm, It depends on the perspective from which they are coming. For example, from the hacking individual, their actions could be seen as ethical if they worked on behalf of their country. Nevertheless, on the opposing end, it may be the exact opposite. However, by working for their country, it should be the nation-states job to take responsibility for their orders. The lack of accountability in countries is the foremost concern that we should have regarding the ethics of cyberwar and is frankly not talked about enough. As mentioned in Hinck & Maurer's article, nations seem to be dealing with attribution by using their citizens as scapegoats. Countries use of is exceptionally unethical as it assigns the blame for the actions of a government onto a single entity. 

One could argue that it is the individual's choice to carry out these attacks, but when not carrying out the attacks could cost the individual their income or life, what are they to do? Nations should implement stricter policies and regulations to develop a standard on how to deal with said cyber attacks.  I believe governments should not blame individual hackers and instead work on building diplomatic meetings with foreign countries to discuss the information or actions the other party is seeking.  While nations see attributing said cybercrimes to individuals as assigning attribution, this is not sustainable.

In saying this, the individual hacker is not completely out of the woods regarding all attacks. While there is no code of ethics regarding cyber-warfare, in particular, codes for security professionals are available.  According to FIRST.org Ethics for Security teams,  members must respect human rights. As we saw with the Refuseniks in Cordeyâ€™s article, they correctly responded by refusing to carry out an order they believed violated human rights. The EthicsfIRST mentions that it is likely that following all aspects of the code may not be possible and that members must make decisions themselves.
