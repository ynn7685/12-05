<h1>Technology Choices</h1>


<h4><p>The choices that are made now in cyber warfare will forever change the landscape when it comes to political and criminal discussions. Nations will soon need to decide on how they will attribute and how this will affect the future of their country. The choices that these countries will heavily rely on the risk and ethics behind each and every attack. 

As mentioned in the portion of the risk, beginning to attribute blame to an individual nation-state could lead to the onset of full-on war. As Libicki notes “Any state can unilaterally declare that a cyber attack is an act of war,” on page 180. While charging an individual for the actions of a nation-state is wrong if charging the nation-state could potentially cause hundreds of deaths, it's clear that countries are likely to choose the first option. It's a nation's priority to protect its citizens from attacks, so likely, the thought of harming an individual working for an attacking countries lively hood is not the first thing on the priority list. Likewise, it is also the state's responsibility to take some level of responsibility if another nation-state catches its actor. However, as mentioned before, the repercussions of accusing another nation-state have a significant risk of war, and countries will likely avoid this by having their actors carry the blame. 

Another novel idea nation-states can take reprisals. Instead of charging an individual or nation-state with reprisals, states have the right to "react to illegal uses of force against them that fall short of an attack."  (Carr, 2011 p.52) This would suggest that nation-states are allowed to "attack back" when they feel another nation has violated their systems. Due to being unconventional, it is not looked upon as a valid method and used only in trace amounts against physical attacks.

Some choices must be made by the individual hacker. Depending on the level of ethicality they hold to themselves and the extent that the hacker is aware of what he is doing, there will always be a line that they might choose or not choose to cross. There have been examples of this happening in recent times. Member's of the Israeli cyber force, better known as unit 8200, has refused to conduct intelligence gathering against Israels' enemies', often being ordinary Palestinian citizens. Forty-three reservists known as "refuseniks" denounced the government in an open letter calling the actions unethical. Here, it is clear that the Israeli military clearly violated a human right of privacy. Luckily, the individual actors were able to prevent this from happening by refusing to conduct their orders. However, this is not viable in every situation. Israel is unique in that its society allows for questioning orders or having "chutzpah". if one will. (Cordey,2019 p.14-17) However, what if one is hired to work for a not so accepting country where obeying orders could mean life or death? Or what if the exact details of what and why they are hacking are hidden from them? In this case, the individual would be entirely out of control of what they choose or do not choose to do.

The level of attack and the future events in cyber-space is to play a prominent role in how nations will persecute and assign attribution to said attacks. The choices that have been made so far show us a warning that nations must act quickly on designing a protocol and method for handling these citations before things are out of control.
